Introduction: Maybe it would be good to have references on how transients help map out the evolution of the universe and investigate mechanisms of stellar death. It would be good to stress that there are scientific cases that depend on having a sample of early light curves. The ZTF papers on this (Yao et al, Miller et al etc) probably have good references ..

Early-time observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are essential to constrain the properties of their progenitors.

Despite being used as standardizable candles to study cosmology, the origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is not settled (see review by Maoz et al. 2014).

Two major channels have been proposed: single degenerate (SD), where a carbon/oxygen white dwarf (WD) accretes matter from a non-degenerate star and triggers an explosion near the Chandrasekhar mass (Whelan and Iben 1973); and double degenerate (DD), in which the primary WD accretes material from (or merges with) another WD (Woosley and Weaver 1994; Tutukov and Yungelson 1996; Shen 2015).

- Observations obtained in the hours to days after explosion (i.e. "early-time") provide a path toward diagnosing the various explosion mechanisms (Maoz et al. 2014).
-  Early photometry can constrain the radii of the possible companion and the progenitor star (Kasen 2010; Nugent et al. 2011; Bloom et al. 2012; Goobar et al. 2014, 2015). 
- The shape and duration of the rising light curves probe the radial distribution of radioactive Ni^56 in the exploding core, as well as the existence of circumstellar material (Dessart et al. 2014; Piro & Nakar 2014; Firth et al. 2015; Piro & Morozova 2016; Miller et al. 2018).
- Simulations of the double detonation of a helium shell on the surface of a WD predict an unusually red excess well before peak luminosity (Noebauer et al. 2017; Maeda et al. 2018; Polin et al. 2019).
- Should the SD channel hold, a collision between the SN ejecta and the stellar companion will give rise to strong ultraviolet (UV) emission at early times (Hayden et al. 2010a; Kasen 2010).
- The power of well-sampled early-time photometry has also been demonstrated in single-object studies of normal SNe Ia (Marion et al. 2016; Hosseinzadeh et al. 2017; Dimitriadis et al. 2019; Shappee et al. 2019, Li et al. 2019), where the clearly resolved early bumps in their light curves pose challenges to simple explosion models.

While it is clear that Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are the result of thermonuclear explosions in C/O white dwarfs (WDs), a great deal remains uncertain about the binary companion that facilitates the explosive disruption of the WD.

The fact that supernovae (SNe) of Type Ia can be empirically
calibrated as standardizable candles has made them arguably
the most important tool in all of physics for the past ∼two
decades. By unlocking our ability to accurately measure
distances at high redshift, SNe Ia have revolutionized our
understanding of the universe (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter
et al. 1999).

While it is all but certain that SNe Ia are the result of
thermonuclear explosions in carbon–oxygen (C/O) white
dwarfs (WDs) in binary star systems (see Maoz et al. 2014;
Livio & Mazzali 2018), there remains a great deal about
SNe Ia progenitors and the precise explosion mechanism that
we do not know. This leads to the tantalizing hope that an
improved understanding of the binary companions or explo-
sion may improve our ability to calibrate these standardizable
candles.

Pinning down the binary companion to the exploding WD
remains particularly difficult. There are likely two dominant
pathways toward explosion. In the first, the WD accretes H or
He from, or merges with the core of, a nondegenerate companion
and eventually explodes as it approaches the Chandrasekhar
mass (M Ch ; known as the single degenerate, or SD, scenario
(Whelan & Iben 1973)). In the second scenario, the explosion
follows the interaction or merger of two WD stars (known as the
double degenerate, or DD, scenario (Webbink 1984)). While the
debate has long focused on which of these two scenarios is
correct, empirical evidence supports both channels.

Now the most pressing questions are the following: which
binary companion WD (DD) or nondegenerate star (SD), and
which mass explosion, M Ch or sub-M Ch , is dominant in the
production of normal SNe Ia?

Observing SNe Ia in the hours to days after explosion
provides a clear avenue toward addressing these pressing
questions (e.g., Maoz et al. 2014).

Finding an SN during thisearly phase probes the progenitor environment and the binary companion, which is simply not possible once the SN evolves
well into the expansion phase (they are standardizable precisely
because they are all nearly identical at maximum light). Indeed,
in the landmark discovery of SN 2011fe, Nugent et al. (2011)
were able to constrain the time of explosion to ±20 minutes—
though see Piro & Nakar (2013, 2014) for an explanation of a
potential early “dark phase.” Bloom et al. (2012) would later
combine the observations in Nugent et al. (2011) with an early
nondetection while comparing the limits to shock-breakout
models to constrain the size of the progenitor to be 0.01 Re ,
providing the most direct evidence to date that SNe Ia come
from WDs.

Early observations also probe the nature of the binary
system. In the SD scenario, the SN ejecta will collide with the
nondegenerate companion, creating a shock that gives rise to a
bright ultraviolet/optical flash in the days after explosion
(Kasen 2010). To date, the search for such a signature in large
samples has typically resulted in a nondetection (e.g., Hayden
et al. 2010; Bianco et al. 2011; Ganeshalingam et al. 2011). 15
Separately, for the DD scenario, some sub-M Ch DD explosions
exhibit a highly unusual color evolution in the ∼2–4 days after
explosion (Noebauer et al. 2017; Polin et al. 2019).

Furthermore, measurements of the SN rise time constrain the
properties of the WD and the explosion. In combination with
the peak bolometric luminosity, the rise time provides a direct
estimate of the ejecta mass (e.g., Arnett 1982; Jeffery 1999).
Regarding the explosions, initial work to estimate the rise times
of SNe Ia clearly demonstrated that early models significantly
underestimated the opacities in the SN ejecta (e.g., Riess et al.
1999). Finally, while the famous luminosity–decline relation-
ship for SNe Ia makes them standardizable (Phillips 1993),
recent evidence suggests that the rise, rather than the decline, of
SNe Ia is a better indicator of their peak luminosity (Hayden
et al. 2019).

To date, we have not reached a consensus on the typical
rise time of SNe Ia. In their seminal study, Riess et al. (1999)
found that the mean rise time of SNe Ia is 19.5±0.2 days,
after correcting the individual SNe for the luminosity–decline
relation (we hereafter refer to these corrections as shape
corrections). Follow-up studies estimated a similar mean
rise time for high-redshift SNe Ia (Aldering et al. 2000;
Conley et al. 2006). 16 In Hayden et al. (2010), Ganeshalingam
et al. (2011), and González-Gaitán et al. (2012), similar
approaches were applied to significantly larger samples of SNe,
and shorter (by 1 day) shape-corrected mean rise times were
found.

As observational cadences have increased over the past
decade, there has been a surge of SNe Ia discovered shortly
after explosion. This has led more recent efforts to focus on
measuring the rise times of populations of individual SNe
(e.g., Firth et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2017; Papadogiannakis
et al. 2019), which is the approach adopted in this study. The
utility of avoiding shape corrections is that it allows one to
search for multiple populations in the distribution of rise times,
which could point to a multitude of explosion scenarios.
While Papadogiannakis et al. (2019) found no evidence for
multiple populations, Ganeshalingam et al. (2011) found that
high-velocity SNe Ia rise ∼1.5 days faster than their normal
counterparts.

We are now in an era where hydrodynamic radiation
transport models have become very sophisticated (e.g.,
Sim et al. 2013; Dessart et al. 2014; Kromer et al. 2016;
Noebauer et al. 2017; Polin et al. 2019; Townsley et al. 2019;
Gronow et al. 2020; Magee et al. 2020). Accurate measure-
ments of the observed distribution of SN Ia rise times can be
compared with models to rule out theoretical scenarios that
evolve too quickly or too slowly (e.g., Magee et al. 2018).
Similarly, if the early emission is modeled as a power law in
time (i.e., f μ t a ), measures of the power-law index α can
confirm or reject different explosion/ejecta-mixing scenarios
(Magee et al. 2020).
